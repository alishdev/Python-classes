FOR LOOPS

Why?
To repeat the same thing multiple (limited) times.

Example:
# print numbers from 1 to 10 included (or 11 excluded)
for number in range(1,11):
    print (number)

# if first value is 0 it don't then it can be omitted
for number in range(11):
    print (number)

# print every second number (odd numbers)
for number in range(1,11,2):
    print (number)

# combine with else to print odd numbers
for number in range(1,11):
    if (number % 2 == 1):
        print (number)

# use continue to skip the rest of the block
for number in range(1,11):
    if (number % 2 == 0):
        continue
    print (number)

# find first number that divides by 5
for number in range(1,11):
    if (number % 5 == 0):
        print (number)
        break

PROBLEMS
3-1. Print numbers that divide by 3 without remainder in a range from 25 to 50 included
3-2. Find a sum of all numbers in a range from 1 to 99 (included)
3-3. Find an average of all numbers in a range from 1 to 99 (included)
3-4. Find the smallest number that divides by 3 and 11 in a range from 500 and 600
3-5. Find the largest number that divides by 3 and 11 in a range from 500 and 600

WHILE LOOPS
# print numbers from 1 to 10 included (or 11 excluded)
number = 1
while number < 11:
    print (number)
    number += 1

# infinite loops
# what happens in this case?
number = 1
while number < 11:
    print (number)
number += 1

PROBLEMS
Rewrite for loop as while loop
3-6. if first value is 0 it don't then it can be omitted
3-7. print every second number (odd numbers)
3-8 combine with else to print odd numbers
3-9 use continue to skip the rest of the block
3-10 find first number that divides by 5 in a range from 1 to 10 included
3-11 find factorial of 10!

POWER OF CONDITIONAL LOOPS
Comes when condition is not known before hand

# Use input function to get input from user
# echo input until user enters stop
entered = input('Enter stop to quit')
while entered != 'stop':
    print(entered)
    entered = input('Enter stop to quit')

USE WHILE INSTEAD OF if
WHILE is using the same logic as IF when deciding whether to continue processing or not`
# How to rewrite following code with with while
hour = 12
if hour < 12:
    print 'Good morning'

3-12. Rewrite following code with while
hour = 12
if hour < 12:
    print ('Good morning')
elif hour < 17:
    print ('Good afternoon')
elif hour < 21:
    print ('Good evening')
else:
    print ('Good night')

3-13. Can this be rewritten with FOR loop and Why?
